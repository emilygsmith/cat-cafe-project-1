## Lighthouse Testing

## Debugging
### Navbar
I noticed that the Navbar was extended slightly wider than the rest of the container. I had a div with the class 'row' and a div with the class 'col navbar' within that. I realised I had to add an additional div inside the column div with the class Navbar, and take the Navbar class out of the column div, and this fixed the issue.

### Get in Touch section
When viewing on mobile, the 'Get in Touch' section was too close to the previous section of 'Opening Hours', when there should have been a gap inbetween. I realised that I was missing a paragraph tag between the divs so I added this in to fix it.
